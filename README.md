<p>In this course, get an introduction to linked lists, a popular and useful dynamic Python data structure. Instructor Ryan Mitchell covers various types of linked lists, and gives you the opportunity to practice your skills with CoderPad challenges in each chapter. Ryan starts with the basicsâ€”how Python lists are stored, the advantages and disadvantages, and how linked lists solve some of these problems. She shows you practical applications of linked lists, and how to build a linked list in Python. Then, find out how to build functionality like searching and sorting a linked list. Ryan then shows you how you can make circular linked lists, doubly-linked lists, and even orthogonal linked lists.</p>
<p>This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.</p>
